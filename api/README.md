# Core API

## Project setup
```
Source the virtual environment [pipenv shell] ( I messed this up, the pipfile are in the previous directory. Will be fix in the future)
Install the dependencies [pipenv install]
Navigate into the backend directory [cd api]
Start the backend server [python manage.py runserver]
